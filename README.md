# GeneticAlgo
A simple, barebones Java library for genetic algorithms. Included in the repository is the library itself as well as a test example involving fitting polynomials.

The test suite is purely a demonstrator, it does not actually produce very well fitting functions simply because 50 randomly generated points can't be covered usually by a quartic function. However, it does make the coefficient of determination go down significantly.
